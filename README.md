- 👋 Hi, I’m @samvpillay-Tester (until I reclaim my main username from work, for personal use)
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to be a better automation tester and developer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Rest Assured, TypeScript, Cypress, C#
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything
- 📫 Find me on LinkedIn if you want to connect
(I'm _not_ currently looking for work though, in case you are recruiting! Sorry)
